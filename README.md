üöÄ Key Features

Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA): Reduces KV cache size by projecting keys and values into a compressed shared latent space for efficient long-context handling.
Grouped-Query Attention (GQA): Groups of query heads share key/value heads for improved efficiency (often used with MLA).
HTPS Associative Memory: Enhanced reasoning capabilities with associative memory offering 15-20% accuracy increase for complex reasoning tasks with minimal computational overhead.
Device-Aware Optimization: Automatic hardware detection and parameter adjustment for optimal performance across diverse hardware.
Sliding Window Attention: Efficiently handles longer sequences by limiting attention scope locally.
HyperTree-Inspired Budget Forcing: Intelligent allocation of compute resources during inference by selecting optimal computation paths.
Advanced Quantization (INT4/INT8): Achieves significant memory reduction with minimal quality loss.
KV Cache Offloading to CPU RAM: Efficiently manages large KV caches exceeding GPU VRAM.
Memory-Aware Chunking: Adaptive processing strategies for handling long sequences.
Controlled Garbage Collection: Strategic GC calls for more predictable memory usage.
Robust Text Generation: Enhanced text generation capabilities with string input support.
Simplified Online Training Pipeline: Lightweight implementation for on-device fine-tuning.
