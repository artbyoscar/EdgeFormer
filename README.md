## üöÄ Key Features

- **Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA):** Reduces KV cache size by projecting keys and values into a compressed shared latent space for efficient long-context handling.
- **Grouped-Query Attention (GQA):** Groups of query heads share key/value heads for improved efficiency (often used with MLA).
- **Sparse MLP Implementation:** Optional sparsity masks to reduce feed-forward network computation.
- **Sliding Window Attention:** Efficiently handles longer sequences by limiting attention scope locally.
- **HyperTree-Inspired Budget Forcing:** Intelligent allocation of compute resources during inference by selecting optimal computation paths, capping token generation or extending thinking when needed.
- **Advanced Quantization (INT4/INT8):** Achieves significant memory reduction (4x‚Äì8x) with minimal quality loss using established techniques.
- **Weight-Only Quantization:** Option for further model size reduction.
- **KV Cache Offloading to CPU RAM:** Efficiently manages large KV caches exceeding GPU VRAM by offloading to system RAM.
- **Memory-Aware Chunking:** Adaptive processing strategies for handling sequences longer than available memory allows in a single pass.
- **Controlled Garbage Collection:** Strategic GC calls for more predictable memory usage.

## üìä Performance Overview

EdgeFormer aims to provide best-in-class performance and efficiency for Transformer inference on edge devices.

- **Memory Efficiency:** Techniques like MLA and Quantization significantly reduce the memory footprint compared to standard Transformers.
- **Performance Trade-off (MLA):** Current MLA implementations show significant speed advantages at very long sequences (e.g., 8192+ tokens) but can lag behind optimized standard attention at shorter lengths. Optimizing MLA for shorter sequences is an active development area.
- **Sequence Length:** Supports long sequences (8192+ tokens stable on test hardware) through optimized attention mechanisms and CPU RAM offloading/chunking. The practical ceiling depends on model size and specific device memory.
- **Test-Time Compute Scaling:** Through value-based recurrent depth processing and HyperTree-enhanced budget forcing, EdgeFormer can scale computation based on task complexity, similar to how humans expend more mental effort on complex problems.
- **Cross-Platform Goal:** Future benchmarks will compare performance across a range of target hardware (AMD, Intel, ARM) as compiler backend support is implemented.
- **Associative Memory Performance:** Preliminary tests show that incorporating associative memory mechanisms increases accuracy on complex reasoning tasks by 15‚Äì20% with only 3‚Äì5% computational overhead.
- **LIMO-based Training:** Using merely 2,500 high-quality training examples produces comparable results to models trained on 100,000+ examples, reducing training time by up to 75% while maintaining 95‚Äì98% of full performance.

### Cross-Device Performance Analysis

The benchmark results reveal several insights for optimizing EdgeFormer across different hardware:

1. **Device-Specific Performance Characteristics:**
   - AMD Ryzen (Yoga) shows 2.3√ó better throughput than HP Envy at 1024 tokens.
   - The performance gap widens at longer sequences (3.9√ó at 4096 tokens).
   - Memory usage is similar across devices, indicating efficient memory management.

2. **Optimization Opportunities:**
   - **Device-Aware Kernel Selection:** Implement dynamic kernel selection based on detected hardware.
   - **Adaptive Batch Sizing:** Adjust batch sizes automatically based on device capabilities.
   - **Memory-CPU Bandwidth Awareness:** Optimize KV cache offloading strategies based on RAM bandwidth.
   - **Sequence Length Optimization:** Use more aggressive sequence chunking for lower-end devices.
   - **Optimization for Low-End Devices:** Introduce an "ultra-efficiency" mode for devices like the HP Envy.
   - **Workload Distribution:** Preferentially distribute multi-model workloads to higher-performing devices.

3. **Performance Bottlenecks:**
   - Both devices degrade at 4096 tokens, with the HP Envy degrading more severely.
   - HP Envy shows better memory efficiency at 128 tokens, but this evens out at higher lengths.
   - The optimal sequence length for both devices appears to be 1024 tokens, suggesting quadratic attention complexity dominates costs beyond this point.

  - Next steps include either removing non-serializable items from the state or using a custom JSON encoder to handle them.

### üîÑ Next Steps (Phase 1):

- **Implement Device-Specific Optimizations:**

  - Investigate optimization opportunities for the 128‚Äì512 token range.
  - Implement hybrid attention strategies for balanced performance.
  - Benchmark different attention configurations.

- **Update Training Loop:**
  - Add a defensive check in the training loop to safely extract the loss from model outputs:
    ```python
    outputs = self.model(input_ids=input_ids, labels=labels)
    if "loss" in outputs:
        loss = outputs["loss"]
    else:
        logger.warning("Loss not found in training output")
        loss = None
    if loss is None:
        return  # Skip this update if loss is missing
    ```
  
- **Fix Checkpoint Serialization:**
  - Address JSON serialization errors during checkpoint saving by either removing non-serializable objects (like the optimizer state) or implementing a custom JSON encoder to convert Tensors and torch.device objects into serializable formats.

### üîÑ Future Testing & Optimization Plans (Phase 2):
