Text generation demos showcase the model's capabilities. Model export functionality allows deployment to different platforms. Documentation is essential for understanding the codebase.

EdgeFormer is a custom transformer implementation for edge devices. Grouped-Query Attention allows query heads to share key and value heads. Sparse MLP implementation uses sparsity masks to reduce computation.

Model export functionality allows deployment to different platforms. INT4 quantization achieves up to 8x memory reduction. Data augmentation techniques improve training robustness.

KV Cache Offloading supports processing very long sequences. RDNA3 Optimizations target AMD Radeon graphics cards. RDNA3 Optimizations target AMD Radeon graphics cards.

Grouped-Query Attention allows query heads to share key and value heads. Sparse MLP implementation uses sparsity masks to reduce computation. Multi-Head Latent Attention reduces the KV cache size significantly.

The model achieves significant memory efficiency improvements. KV Cache Offloading supports processing very long sequences. The project structure includes examples and utility scripts.
