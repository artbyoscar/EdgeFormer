# EdgeFormer Benchmark Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the performance characteristics of EdgeFormer across different devices and sequence lengths.

## Key Findings

1. **Optimal Sequence Length**: Performance peaks at 1024 tokens for most devices, with a throughput of 969-2240 tokens/second.

2. **Cross-Device Performance**: 
   - AMD Ryzen (Yoga) shows 2.3× better throughput than HP Envy at 1024 tokens.
   - The performance gap widens at longer sequences (3.9× at 4096 tokens).

3. **Memory Usage**: 
   - Memory scales linearly with sequence length
   - Similar memory efficiency across devices at longer sequences

4. **Performance Bottlenecks**:
   - Both devices show performance degradation at 4096+ tokens
   - HP Envy degrades more severely with sequence length

5. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Strong negative correlation (-0.48) between tokens/second and execution time
   - Strong positive correlation (0.95) between sequence length and execution time
   - Moderate correlation (0.73) between memory usage and execution time

## Optimization Opportunities

1. **Device-Aware Kernel Selection**: Implement dynamic kernel selection based on detected hardware.
2. **Adaptive Batch Sizing**: Adjust batch sizes automatically based on device capabilities.
3. **Memory-CPU Bandwidth Awareness**: Optimize KV cache offloading strategies based on RAM bandwidth.
4. **Sequence Length Optimization**: Use more aggressive sequence chunking for lower-end devices.
5. **Ultra-Efficiency Mode**: Introduce an "ultra-efficiency" mode specifically for devices like the HP Envy.
