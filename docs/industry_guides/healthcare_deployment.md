# EdgeFormer for Medical Devices

### Regulatory Compliance
- FDA accuracy requirements: <1% (EdgeFormer: 0.5% âœ…)
- Memory constraints: 70% reduction achieved
- Real-time processing: Validated on edge hardware

### Example: Portable Ultrasound
```python
ultrasound_model_compressed = quantize_model(
    ultrasound_model, 
    mode="medical_grade"
)
# Result: 0.3% accuracy loss, 3.8x compression
