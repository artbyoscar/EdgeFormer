### Future Security and Compliance Plans

EdgeFormer's healthcare implementation roadmap includes:

- **Data Protection**: Encryption for sensitive data in memory and storage
- **Access Controls**: Framework for role-based access with audit capabilities
- **Compliance Features**: Configurable options to meet healthcare regulations
- **Anonymization**: Tools for automatic de-identification of protected health information

### Current Configuration Options

The ECG analysis demo supports the following configuration options:

```python
# Current healthcare demo configuration
config = EdgeFormerConfig(
    hidden_size=256,
    num_hidden_layers=4,
    num_attention_heads=8,
    attention_type="mla",  # or "gqa" or "standard"
    latent_size=64  # for MLA attention
)
```

Future versions will add healthcare-specific parameters:
```python
# Planned future configuration (not yet implemented)
healthcare_config = HealthcareConfig(
    domain="cardiology",
    hipaa_compliant=True,
    data_protection_level="high"
)
```

## Getting Started with the Current Demo

To run the current ECG analysis demonstration:

1. **Ensure dependencies are installed**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
   ```

2. **Run the ECG analysis demo**:
   ```bash
   python examples/healthcare/ecg_analysis_demo.py --visualize
   ```

3. **Experiment with different options**:
   ```bash
   # Try different attention mechanisms
   python examples/healthcare/ecg_analysis_demo.py --attention gqa

   # Run performance profiling
   python examples/healthcare/ecg_analysis_demo.py --profile
   
   # Disable memory component for comparison
   python examples/healthcare/ecg_analysis_demo.py --no-memory
   ```
